# About Me
## Things I'm Passionate about
 * ### **Animals -** 
  ### My family and I used to own about 9 acres of land in Asheboro, NC, where we cared for a variety of animals over the years—horses, cats, dogs, pigs, ferrets, and even a few snakes. Growing up around animals instilled a strong sense of responsibility in me when it comes to their care. Although we’ve downsized to about an acre of land now, we still look after 4 cats and 6 dogs (yes, it can be a madhouse!). 
### I also feed stray animals in our community and used to volunteer at a local canine rescue—despite being more of a cat person (sorry!). Unfortunately, I had to stop volunteering due to time constraints but I'm happy I had the opportunity!
  * ### **Traveling -**
  ### I love to travel and have visited nearly all of the eastern and western United States. Unfortunately, I haven’t had much opportunity to explore up north, aside from a trip to New York City. Internationally, I’ve only been outside the U.S. once, when I studied at EPITA, a college in Paris, France, for a short time. I’d love to explore more of Europe in the future, and my biggest dream is to visit Japan one day!
 * ### **Electronics**
  ### I’ve always loved messing with electronics—building them, taking them apart to see how they work, and repairing them. It’s one of the few things I’m genuinely decent at, and despite my very poor eyesight, It’s become a passion of mine that I hope to learn more about!
